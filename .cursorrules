# Cursor AI Rules for scratch-project-guides project

## Environment Setup
- Always run `nvm use` at the start of any terminal session to ensure correct Node.js version
- This is a static site generated with SvelteKit which hosts project guides for Scratch projects.

## Code Quality Standards
- Always run formatting, linting, and testing when making changes:
  - `npm run format` - Format code
  - `npm run lint` - Lint code  
  - `npm run check` - Svelte check
  - `npm run test` - Run tests
- Fix any linting errors before considering changes complete
- Ensure all tests pass before finalizing changes

## Project Context
- This is a project aimed at a school audience for sharing scratch project instructions.
- It is a static site that parses markdown files in the `projects` directory as the source of truth for the guides on the site.
- Uses TypeScript throughout

## Development Workflow
1. Run `nvm use` to set correct Node version
2. Make code changes
3. Run `npm run format` to format code
4. Run `npm run lint` to check for issues
5. Run `npm run check` to check for issues
6. Run `npm run test` to verify tests pass
7. If you are changing a markdown file then run `npm run generate-projects` because it will generate up-to-date versions of the javascript objects.
8. Only consider changes complete when all quality checks pass
