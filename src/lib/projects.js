					"# Math Quiz 🧮\n\n## Make an addition quiz tool\n\nhttps://scratch.mit.edu/projects/805521735/\n\nIn this project we will create a game where the player is quizzed on their addition facts.\n\nWe will start by creating two variables. `FirstNumber` will stand for our first number and `SecondNumber` will stand for our second number. When our game begins we will set each of them to a random number between 1 and 10.\n\n```scratchblocks\nwhen green flag clicked\nset [FirstNumber v] to (pick random [1] to [10])\nset [SecondNumber v] to (pick random [1] to [10])\n```\n\nThen we need to ask the player what they think the answer is. We can do this using the `ask` block.\n\n```scratchblocks\nask (join [What is ] (join (FirstNumber) (join [ + ] (join (SecondNumber) [?])))) and wait\n```\n\nNext we'll handle figuring out if the player's `answer` is correct. If they are, we'll say \"Great job!\". If they aren't, we'll tell them what the correct answer was.\n\n```scratchblocks\nif <(answer) = ((FirstNumber) + (SecondNumber))> then\n    say [Great job!]\n    wait (2) seconds\nelse\n    say (join [Not quite.

					"# Pong 🏓\n\n## Make the classicc game\n\nhttps://scratch.mit.edu/projects/801064832\n\nFirst we'll make a `Ball` sprite.\nAt the start it should go to the center then point in a random direction.\nWhile the game is going it should move and bounce if it hits an edge.\n\n```scratchblocks\nwhen green flag clicked\ngo to x: (0) y: (0)\npoint in direction (pick random (-180) to (180))\nforever\n    move (5) steps\n    if on edge, bounce\nend\n```\n\nNext we'll make two sprites to be paddles.\nThe first sprite `Player` will be our player's paddle and it will move according to the mouse.\nWhen the game starts we will put the paddle on the left side of the screen.\nWhile the game is being played we will repeatedly set the paddle `y` position to the mouse's `y` position\n\n```scratchblocks\nwhen green flag clicked\nset x to (-190)\nforever\n    set y to (mouse y)\nend\n```\n\nThe second sprite `Bot` will be our bot's paddle.\nWhen the game start we will put the paddle on the right side of the screen.\n\n```scratchblocks\nwhen green flag clicked\ngo to x: (190) y: (0)\n```\n\nTo help the bot follow the ball we will create a variable to track the ball's position.\nThis variable should exist for all sprites and we will set it to the ball's `y` position when the `Ball` sprite moves.\n\n```scratchblocks\nforever\n    move (5) steps\n    if on edge, bounce\n    set [BallY v] to (y position)\nend\n```\n\nThe `Bot` sprite can then follow the `Ball` sprite like so.\n\n```scratchblocks\nwhen green flag clicked\ngo to x: (190) y: (0)\nforever\n    glide (0.2) secs to x: (190) y: (BallY)\nend\n```\n\nWe have a ball that bounces around the screen and paddles that move.\nNext we need to make the ball bounce off the paddles.\nLet's add a section in the `forever` block of our `Ball` sprite to point in the direction of a bounce if the ball touches either paddle.\n\n```scratchblocks\nforever\n    move (5) steps\n    if on edge, bounce\n    set [BallY v] to (y position)\n    if <<touching (Player v)?> or <touching (Bot v)?>> then\n        point in direction ((direction) * (-1))\n    end\nend\n```\n\nNotice that nothing happens when a player misses the ball. Next we'll create two goal sprites called `Player Goal` and `Bot Goal` to help us determine when a player scores. Place the `Player Goal` sprite on the left side of the screen behind the `Player`. Make sure it covers the whole height of the screen, then do the same on the right side of the screen for the `Bot Goal` sprite.\n\nWe're also going to introduce two new variables called `Player Score` and `Bot Score`. Make sure they are checked in the block palette so that you can position the scores on screen for the players to see. Finally, we can add logic to the `Ball` sprite to increment the score when a player scores a goal. We will put it right after the section where we check if the ball is touching a player.\n\n```scratchblocks\nif <<touching (Player v)?> or <touching (Bot v)?>> then\n    point in direction ((direction) * (-1))\nend\nif <touching (Player Goal v)?> then\n    change [Bot Score v] by (1)\nend\nif <touching (Bot Goal v)?> then\n    change [Player Score v] by (1)\nend\n```\n\nPress the green flag to play the game and notice what happens when either player scores a goal. The score goes up by more than 1! That is because the `forever` loop is repeating multiple times while the ball is still touching the goal. We can fix this by resetting the ball to the center of the screen once someone has scored a point.\n"
